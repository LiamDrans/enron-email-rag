# Enron Email RAG System

This project explores the design and implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Enron Email Dataset. The focus is on building an end-to-end pipeline that ingests, processes, embeds, and retrieves large volumes of unstructured email data, enabling semantic search and LLM-based querying at scale.

The broader goal is to develop practical skills in Python, vector databases, LLM integration, and prompt engineering, while designing systems that make large document collections queryable for non-technical users.
